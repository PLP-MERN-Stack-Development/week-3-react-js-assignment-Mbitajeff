# Unique Week 3 React App

A modern, responsive React application built by Jeff Mbita(Me) for the Week 3 assignment. This project demonstrates my skills in React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, component architecture, state management, hooks, API integration, and global dark mode.

## 🚀 Features
- Fully responsive design for all devices
- Global light/dark theme switcher
- My own reusable UI components (Button, Card, Navbar, Footer, Layout)
- Task Manager with persistent tasks (add, complete, delete, filter)
- API integration with search, infinite scroll, and error/loading states
- Clean, maintainable code with custom hooks and context
